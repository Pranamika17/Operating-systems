The scheduling algorithm that I have implemented is shortest job first.This is a  simple algorithm where the process with the least run time is picked up next ie the process with the highest runtime is executed at the very end.


So,in the test program I have spawned 16 processes and have assigned a running time to each of them based on their process id.Running time is assigned such that the earlier process has a greater running time.
For eg: child 0 has a greater running time than child 1 and child 1 has a greater running time than child 2.
So,as seen in the screenshot attached ,after all the process are spawned ,the process 15 which has the lowest running time is picked up followed by process 14 and so on.
So,process 1 followed by process 0 are executed at  the very end.
